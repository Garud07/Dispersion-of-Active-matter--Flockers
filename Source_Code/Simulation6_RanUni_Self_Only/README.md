# 2d_active_matter
# Simulation6_RanUni_Self_Only

This repository contains the sixth simulation 
in the active matter study series.  
Here, particles are **randomly initialized 
with a uniform spatial distribution** and 
evolved **only under self-propulsion 
dynamics** (no flow, no Stokes drag).  
The purpose is to isolate and examine 
the **intrinsic alignment and collective 
behavior** of active particles in the 
absence of external flow fields.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Simulation Details

- **Flow Field:** None  
- **Initial Distribution:** Random and spatially uniform  
- **Dynamics:** Self-propelled motion only (Vicsek-type model without drag)  
- **Noise:** Configurable stochastic term for directional randomness  
- **Objective:**  
  Study spontaneous order formation, clustering, and orientation alignment without flow influence.
